Chris Frederick
My full first name is Christopher, but I prefer to be called Chris
I'm in section 294
I prefer Java, Java Spring or Spring Boot, no preference on flavor of SQL. I am familiar with MVC.
I'm really bad at taking PTO, but I plan on taking some time off around Thanksgiving and Christmas.


--Modification for Activity 3
--This is my update for step 2, which should create the merge conflict.
--I used the conflict resolution guide provided by GitHub to walk through cleaning up the conflict.
