Christian Rodriguez
You're more than welcome to call me Christian or Chris I really dont mind.
I am in section 294
At the moment I am best at MySql and Java, so I would say I probably prefer those.
I am about to get married in exactly 3 weeks, October 13, and will be traveling out of the country the last week of this course.
