Because I don't want this public file to contain too much info, I will just list my first name.

My name is Christopher.
But please call me just Chris. Christopher is something only my parents call me by when I'm in trouble!
I'm currently a 394 student.
I've worked as a software developer for about two and a half years professionally before going back to working as an escalation point for Help Desk.
I have been exposed to a plethora of languages and databases.
I know how to code in Java, Python, JavaScript, and a little bit of Powershell and C.
I've also worked with several different databases such as MySQL, MicroSoft SQL Server, and MongoDB.
I've come to enjoy working in all of those databases and don't have a preference. 
I do think that I'm above average when it comes to writing queries and reports.
I base this on the fact that I'm familiar with concepts such as multiple joins, case statements, etc.
I don't have any vacation plans this semester, but I do consistently work 5 to 15 hours or more of overtime a week.
